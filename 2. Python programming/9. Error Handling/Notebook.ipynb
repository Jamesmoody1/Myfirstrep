    "- However, when there is an error Python will stop executing the code there and then, preventing any subsequent code from running.\n",
    "- Hence, we use error and exception handling to circumvent this, and allow blocks of our code to run despite errors.\n",
    "- We will learn 3 new keywords here, __try__, __except__ and __finally__.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- try clause: this indicates the block of code we want to attempt to run, it will only finish if there are no errors.\n",
    "- except clause: if there is an error in the try clause, the execution will stop there and the except clause will be run.\n",
    "- finally clause: this is the block of code to be run regardless of any errors.\n",
